OpenRadio Computer Aided Transciever Interface
==============================================

This code provides an easy-to-use way of controlling the OpenRadio SDR from within hamlib compatible software. Most testing will be done via CubicSDR: https://github.com/cjcliffe/SoapySDR

Currently it aims to implement changing the RX frequency only, by emulating the protocol for an FT-895/897 radio. There may be a simpler way of doing this!


TODO
====
[*] Get Started!
[ ] Test on hardware
[ ] implement TX somehow.
